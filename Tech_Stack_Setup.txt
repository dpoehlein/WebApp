## Tech Stack Overview

Our web application is built using the following technologies:

### Frontend:

- Framework: React (via Vite for fast development and hot module replacement)
- Routing: React Router
- Styling: CSS (index.css for global styles)
- Package Manager: npm

### Backend:

- To Be Integrated (Currently frontend-focused, backend may be FastAPI or Node.js)

### Database:

- MongoDB (Planned for dynamic content storage)

### Development Tools:

- Code Editor: VS Code
- Version Control: Git
- Browser Developer Tools: Chrome DevTools
- Build Tool: Vite

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Required Software

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (Download from https://nodejs.org/)
- Git (Download from https://git-scm.com/)
- VS Code (Recommended) or any other code editor

### 2. Clone the Project Repository

If using Git, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sst-webapp.git
cd sst-webapp/frontend
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

## Debugging Common Issues

### Issue: Styles Not Loading

Fix: Ensure `index.css` is imported correctly in `main.jsx`:

```
import './index.css';
```

Then restart the server:

```
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "react-router-dom" Not Found

Fix: Install React Router:

```
npm install react-router-dom
```

### Issue: "react-scripts is not recognized"

Fix: Reinstall dependencies:

```
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Issue: Vite Not Detecting Changes

Fix: Clear Viteâ€™s cache and restart:

```
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```
